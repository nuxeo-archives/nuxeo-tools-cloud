# Ansible playbook for Jenkins slave image generation

Generate an Ubuntu image for use by Jenkins as a slave.

## Requirements

 - ansible 1.8.2 or later + https://github.com/stansonhealth/ansible-modules-core/commit/250acf0e76d9858595d3f35ea3bfa8e06f6c958e

=> apply the following patch on ansible/modules/core/packaging/os/apt.py:

 - existing nexus user and group with ID 1003
 - existing hudson user and group with ID 1005
 - current user must have SSH access to host target as ubuntu
 - current user must be sudoer
 - current user must be member of the hudson group
 - gargantua:/volume1/Build mounted to /opt/build

For docker tests:

 - current user must be in docker group (to invoke docker commands)
 - docker-py must be installed (pip install docker-py)


## Generate/update image

Prod:
ansible-playbook -i inventory/production/hosts slave.yml [-v]

## Testing

ansible-playbook -i inventory/stage/hosts slave.yml -v -c local [--ask-sudo-pass]
ansible-playbook -i inventory/stage/hosts slave.yml [-K]
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --list-hosts

Docker test:
ansible-playbook -i inventory/docker/hosts, docker.yml -v

## Complete procedure with Jenkins

Log on https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=eu-west-1#s=Instances

### Jenkins slave template generation

Technical details:

 - based on ami-89fa71fe (from http://alestic.com/ or http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/)
(trusty 14.04 LTS amd64 ebs-ssd 20150209.1 ami-89fa71fe aki-52a34525)

Launch an instance:

 - from community AMI: ami-89fa71fe
 - with m1.small type
 - set "Jenkins slave template <DATE>" as name
 - associate the key pair
 - set 'default' security group (it's preconfigured to fit requirements)

Copy its public hostname into `nuxeo-tools-cloud/ansible/jenkins/production`.
Issue from `nuxeo-tools-cloud/ansible/jenkins/`:

     ansible-playbook -i hosts-production slave.yml -v

### Jenkins slave AMI generation

Select the "Jenkins slave template <DATE>" instance on AWS interface and click "Action / Create Image (EBS AMI)".
Set "`Jenkins_AMI_<DATE>_slave`" as name.
Browse https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Images:
Copy the AMI ID (for instance ami-a3b1a7d7).

Repeat the operation to generate an identical AMI with name: "`Jenkins_AMI_<DATE>_ondemand`"

### Jenkins configuration

Browse https://qa.nuxeo.org/jenkins/configure#section147
In the "Cloud / Amazon EC2 / AMIs" section, set the AMI ID and check its availability ("Check AMI" button).
Instance Type: C3Xlarge.
Label "SLAVE".
Jobs must set "SLAVE" as slave restriction to use that EC2 image.

Same for the "ondemand" label with the second AMI.

You can ask for an image from https://qa.nuxeo.org/jenkins/computer/ with "Provision via EC2" button.

### AWS cleanup

Delete unused old AMIs. Delete unused associated "snapshot" volumes.
